# RSA Encryption and Decryption - Network Security Assignment

## Introduction

This project implements a simple RSA encryption and decryption system in Python that runs entirely through the terminal.
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages securely using basic principles of number theory and modular arithmetic.

## Features
- Randomly generates RSA key pairs (public and private keys).

- Encrypts messages character-by-character.

- Decrypts encrypted messages back to their original form.

- Works purely in the command-line / terminal (no GUI).

- Uses primes loaded from a file (primes-to-100k.txt) or a predefined list.

- Modular exponentiation and Extended Euclidean Algorithm implemented manually.
